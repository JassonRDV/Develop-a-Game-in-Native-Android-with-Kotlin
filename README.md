# Develop a Game in Native Android with Kotlin  

🚀 **Developing a Native Android Game with Kotlin**  

This project is an idle DPS game called **Beat Frantically**, built using native Android with Kotlin.  
The goal is to defeat monsters, collect rewards, and progress through the game. The code is entirely **open-source** and created for educational purposes.

## 🎮 **Game Features**  

- **Dynamic Monsters**: Each monster has unique difficulty levels and rewards (*under development*).  
- **Progressive Gameplay**: Use rewards to level up.  
- **Death Tracking**: Persistent tracking of the number of monster deaths.  
- **Vertical 2D**: Experience optimized for mobile devices.

## 🧑‍💻 **Contributions**  

- At the moment, the project is not ready for contributions.  
- I am learning as I code, so the current codebase is quite messy.  
- I am constantly improving and solving issues, but if you enjoy challenges, feel free to get in touch. 😊

## 🪁 **Plans**  

- I plan to incorporate the latest advancements in Android development with Kotlin.  
- Add data persistence and save player gameplay on Firebase.  
- Currently, the game uses AI-generated images that mimic pixel art.  
- However, for the final project, I will create the 2D artwork myself, as I am also a **2D and 3D artist**.
